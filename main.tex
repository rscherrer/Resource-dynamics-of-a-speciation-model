\maketitle

This report compares the behavior of two types of resource dynamics in the context of a speciation model where two resources are available for a population of organisms to feed on. The first type of dynamics is a chemostat-like dynamics, where the resource is assumed to be inorganic, flowing into the landscape and flushed out at a certain rate. The second type of dynamics is a logistic dynamics, where the resource is biotic and has its own growth rate and carryinc capacity. Here we show in what aspects these two implementations differ and what the consequences are for the population of feeders.
